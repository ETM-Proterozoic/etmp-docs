ETM/P blockchain is designed to be an underlying economic infrastructure
for a Web3.0 ecosystem. It will be owned and controlled by its
participants via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).\
ETM token is designed as a payment method as well as long-term reserve
asset for the entire ETM/P ecosystem. It is designed to be of bounded
volume, scheduled inflation. It will be used also for DeFi collateral
and participation of future protocol governance.\
Total token supply 5,000,000,000\
Staking reward 40%\
Ecosystem 20%\
ETM Foundation 10%\
Strategic investment 20%\
Liquidity management 3%\
Founding team 7%\
Staking reward schedule:\
15% of the total staking reward is allocated in the first year, which
incurs the inflation $$\frac{40\%\times 0.15}{60\%}=10\%,$$ 16% of the
remaining total staking reward is allocated in the second year, which
incurs the inflation
$$\frac{40\%\times (1-0.15)\times 0.16}{60\%+40\%\times 0.15}=8.24\%,$$
17% of the remaining total staking reward is allocated in the third
year, which incurs the inflation
$$\frac{40\%\times (1-0.15)\times (1-0.16)\times 0.17}{60\%+40\%\times 0.15+40\%\times (1-0.15)\times 0.16}=6.796\%,$$
Once the yearly inflation is fixed, the actual staking reward can be
calculated and distributed using our dynamic equilibrium model.\
The proportion allocated to the Ecosystem, the ETM Foundation and
Strategic investment will be released by 10% at the beginning of the
token circulation. The remaining 90% will be released at a linear rate
in 45 months. These tokens are for ecosystem development to help
bootstrap network effects and ensure a diverse and accessible community
over the long term. Lockup mechanism has been implemented and the
distributed tokens become liquid only gradually via a smart contract.
This is to ensure: 1. the tokens are used for building a decentralized
community with sustainable development; 2. to alleviate the downward
price pressure due to inflation (flatten the curve).\
The liquidity management allocation will be controlled by the ETM
foundation and released at the beginning of the token circulation. This
is particularly important for managing the price volatility due to
possible wild speculations in the early phase of the project launching.\
The token allocation for the founding team will be locked for 6 months
and then released linearly in 10 months. ETM/P has been developed and
brought to market by a team of interdisciplinary background. The lockup
period is to incentivize them to be aligned.\
