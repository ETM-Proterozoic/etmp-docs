On the other hand,\nexcessive inflation can create a range of unintended consequences and\ncauses downward pressure on the token prices (denominated by the\nstablecoins, for example). Therefore, staking reward needs to be\ncarefully tuned to balance between bounded inflation and incentive for\nstaking nodes. This is also important for attracting new users and\nexpanding the ecosystem. Since all rewards are denominated in ETM/P\ntokens, even though high reward may boost the inflow of new users in the\nshort term, the potential devaluation of the native token caused by high\ninflation will discourage users in the long term.\\\nThe automatic adjustments of the parameters to control the ETM/P\neconomic system is guided by the real time dynamic rebalancing. This is\none of the key features and main innovations of ETM/P for optimizing\nuser incentives and achieving a stable dynamic equilibrium. By updating\nsmart contract aggregate variables after each block, triggered by\ninteraction of users with the smart contract itself, the dynamic\nequilibrium mechanism improves the reward transparency and price\ncontinuity in the economic system. Users can engage more actively in\ntransactions with less risk. Moreover, the smart contracts of ETM/P use\ndynamic, data driven models to manage risk and provide value to the\nusers.\\\nWe outline some details of the real time dynamic rebalancing mechanism\nand how it achieves a state of equilibrium:\\\nThe first year inflation rate is $i=0.1$ and will be adjusted year by\nyear. For more details we refer to the section on ETM tokenomics. We can\nthen calculate the inflation per each block. Let $i_n$ denotes the\ninflation rate per block, since inflation is always compounded we have\\\n$$n=20\\times 60\\times 24\\times 365=10512000.$$\n$$(1+i_n)^n=1+i, \\,\\,\\,\\ln(1+i_n)=\\frac{1}{n}\\ln(1+i).$$ Since $i_n$ is\nvery small, we can use the formula $\\ln(1+i_n)\\approx i_n$ and obtain\n$$i_n=\\frac{1}{n}\\ln(1+i).$$ We can then calculate the reward to be\ndistributed after each block. Each validator can claim its reward\naccording to its proportion in the staking pool. With the action of each\nnode (stake, un-stake), the smart contract recalculates and updates the\ncurrent distribution of the staking pool.\\\nWe can obtain a simple estimate of the APY given the current data. Let\n$B_n$ denotes the total token in circulation at the time of block $n$\nand $S_n$ denotes the number of tokens staked. $r_n$ denotes the reward\nper token of the each staking node.\n$$S_n\\times r_n=B_n\\times i_n \\times(1-\\delta).$$ Let $\\delta$ denotes\nthe direct allocation of the inflation to reward the validators for\nperforming their duties, for now let $\\delta=0$. When $S_n/B_n$ is\nsmall, marginal reward will automatically increase to incentivize\nstaking. On the other hand, marginal reward will decrease when\n$S_n/B_n$, in order to incentivize the utilization of the token.\\\nSuppose $B/S$ remains constant, it can be used to estimate the APY, such\nthat\n$$r=(1+r_n)^n=(1+\\frac{B}{S}\\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\ln(1+i))^n \\approx (i+1)^{B/S}.$$\nThis will help the validator estimates the potential P&L and makes\ndecisions dynamically. However, it should be noted this estimate may be\nfar from the true APY as one cannot predict the fluctuation of $S_n/B_n$\nas $n$ changes.\\\nIt is worth noting that, by smart contract structural design, rational\nagents in the ETM economic system are incentivized to use feedback\ncontrol strategies. A feedback control strategy means that implementing\nthe optimal control as a simple deterministic function evaluation at the\ncurrent state of the system. More concretely, a node searching seeking\nto maximize stake yield will adjust its token asset allocation by\nobserving the aggregate staking ratio. The feedback control allows us to\nunderstand the cause of a decision, and explain its dependence on the\nstate dynamics and policy constraints. A feedback control also allows us\nto justify the fairness of the token distribution mechanism.\\\nThe prospect of modeling and numerical simulation for ETM economic\nsystem goes far beyond simple APY estimation. By implementing real time\ndynamic rebalancing mechanism, ETM opens the door to the wide\napplications of continuous time financial models, forward backward\nstochastic differential equations and partial differential equations.\nSystemic risk, liquidation risk and all kinds of factors can be modeled\nand simulated much more accurately in the ETM economic system than\nprevious PoS systems. This will pave the way to the composition of\ncomplicated financial instruments (the DeFi Lego) with data driven,\nquantitative risk management."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
