Therefore, even though the same rules apply to each node,\nthey might not be choosing the same actions. Nodes are not always\ncollaborative, they might have conflicts of interests. This is\nparticularly so when token/resource distribution is at stake. The\nselfish pursuit of utility by each node would cause friction or what is\ncalled price of anarchy. The dynamics of incentivized, autonomous nodes\nmay be much less efficient than a hypothetical group of nodes directed\nby an intelligent and benevolent central planner.
